# Validation — 0.3.0 public API boundary

## Current checks

- 25 Python tests pass: snapshot validity/freshness, demo isolation, paging, selected-data bounds, query filtering/joins/grouping/aggregation, cited source authority/version labels, and MCP transport.
- MCP transport verifies exactly seven tools, all read-only. No raw-field, screenshot or input tools are registered.
- Boundary tests check the mod namespace and reject reflection, native input/capture, process launch and engine-resource bypass patterns in production Java source. These tests supplement source review, not a complete security proof.
- Three production Java source files compile against the installed 0.71.44 JAR with Java 16 target bytecode. Detached JSON serialization tests pass.

## Rebuilt-mod copied-save test

The new 0.3.0 mod was loaded in an isolated Linux user profile using Java21 and a copied save. All 18 domains returned partial coverage. The installed-help catalog contained 720 records; a structured query ranked the 42 resource rows by stockpile storage and returned only selected IDs/values. No control mailbox was created. Original saves were not modified.

## Explicit limitations

The script lifecycle is documented in the shipped SCRIPT source and semi-official script guide. Most individual data getters are public APIs verified in shipped source, not separately documented stable contracts. API_BOUNDARY.md records that distinction. Complete state access is not claimed.

No UI context or gameplay control is exported. The prior native-input and private-reflection tests are historical and do not apply to this build. All menus, battles, world-map transitions and load/reload combinations have not been validated.

GameDisposable promises cleanup on the next game initialization. JVM shutdown also closes the exporter. Immediate return-to-menu detection is not established without an appropriate public lifecycle hook; stale state expires after 30 seconds. No large-city frame-time or cross-platform performance claim is made.
